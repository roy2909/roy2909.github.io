    <p>Hi! I'm Rahul, a robotics engineer passionate about solving complex problems through innovative robotic solutions. Whether programming a quadruped to explore unknown territories or teaching a robot arm to knock down bowling pins, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in robotics.</p>

  <p>My journey began with watching R2-D2 on TV and has evolved into bringing robots to life at Walt Disney Imagineering. From underwater robots to quadrupeds, I've immersed myself in diverse robotic realms, always seeking the next exciting challenge.</p>

  <p>My technical expertise includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming Languages: Python, C++, C, MATLAB</li>
    <li>Robotics Frameworks: ROS 2/(ROS), Gazebo, MoveIt2</li>
    <li>Computer Vision: OpenCV, YOLO, SLAM</li>
    <li>Embedded Systems and more</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, I'm proficient in Linux, Git, CMake, and Unit Testing. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects that shape the future of robotics.</p>
