<p>I am Rahul Roy, a robotics engineer with a passion for solving real world complex problems through cutting edge robotic solutions. I am driven to fuse software and hardware, crafting sustainable robotic solutions for a better world.</p>

<p>I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Manipal Institue of Technology, India and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics from Northwestern University. </p>

<p>During my internships at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, DRDO, and the Central Research Laboratory, BEL, I worked in a team building practical robotic navigation projects. I worked on implementing core algorithms like trilateration and triangulation while learning about various communication protocols like CAN, UDP and TCP.
For my final undergraduate project, I worked on implementing autonomous navigation through waypoints on a Husky A200 robot while comparing planner algorithms like the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) planner and the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner.</p>

<p>My Master's journey in robotics at Northwestern has been really exciting so far. I worked on several projects including a Motion Controlled Differential Drive Robot with an IR sensor Operated Gripper and most notably a 7 DOF Emika Franka arm that can autonomously scan, aim and knock down colored bowling pins.</p>

<p>I have a broad skill set covering Python and C programming, complemented by hands-on experience in ROS2/(ROS), Gazebo, MoveIt, OpenCV, SLAM, Computer Vision,YOLO and Embedded Systems. Additionally, I'm proficient in Linux, Git, CMake, and Unit Testing. </p>
