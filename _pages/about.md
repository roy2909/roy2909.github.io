    <p>Hi there! I'm Rahul, a robotics engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative robotic solutions. Whether it's programming a quadruped to explore unknown territories or teaching a robot arm to knock down bowling pins, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible in robotics.</p>

    <p>My journey has taken me from watching R2D2 on TV to bringing robots to life at Walt Disney Imagineering. From underwater robots to quadrupeds, I've dipped my toes (and servos) into diverse robotic realms, always seeking the next exciting challenge.</p>

    <p>I have a broad skill set covering Python and C programming, complemented by hands-on experience in ROS 2/(ROS), Gazebo, MoveIt2, OpenCV, SLAM, Computer Vision, YOLO, and Embedded Systems. Additionally, I'm proficient in Linux, Git, CMake, and Unit Testing.</p>
