    "title": "Using Machine Learning to Identify Individual Ants",
    "body": "2023/08/10 - Machine Learning, Python, Computer Vision, OpenCV, PyTorch, C++ Overview: The goal of this project was to create a system that could identify individual ants in a colony. Usinga machine vision camera equipped with a macro lens, I was able to collect 27,244 imagesof 55 different harvester ants. These images were then used to train a machine learningnetwork to create a feature vector, or embedding, to describe each ant. By comparing embeddings of twoants, a threshold could be used to determine if the ants are the same or different with and accuracy of 86. 04%.  View it on Github: Why Ants?: The first reaction when I tell people about this project is typically something along the lines of “howis this useful?” or “why would you want to do that?”. The answer is that for most people, it’s notuseful at all. However, for myrmecologists (ant scientists), it is very useful. Ants are very social insects that are commonly used to study social behavior and can be used to learn more about how swarmsof robots can be used to accomplish tasks. The current way of tracking individual ants in a colony isan extremely tedious process that involves manually labeling each ant in a colony by painting differentpatterns on them. Check out this video to see exactly how tediousthis process can be. By creating a system that can automatically identify individual ants, we can save researchers a lot of time and effort. Project Setup and Hardware: To collect images of the ants, I used a Blackfly S camera from FLIR equipped with a macro lens. The camera was mounted on a microscope stand and placed above a 3D printed channel that the ants couldwalk through. By using this setup, the ants were forced to walk in a straight line in the camera’sfield of view. This entire setup was then placed inside of a light box to ensure consistent lighting.   The image below shows the entire setup. There were two main living chambers for the ants. One for antsthat data had already been collected for and one for ants that data still needed to be imaged. There arealso multiple 3D printed gates to control the flow of ants from the living chambers to the data collectionarea.  Setup Overview Data Collection: By using the setup described above, I was able to I was able to collect 27,244 imagesof 55 different harvester ants. The traffic control gates were used to isolated one ant in the data collection area. This allowed me to collect a videos of one ant at a time.  Ant Imaging Channel and Image To interact with the Blackfly camera and collect videos of the ants walking through the imaging channel, I had to first create a library in C++to interface with the camera. It allowed me to control all of the camera’s settings and collect videos. I also created a scripts to semi-automatically collect videos of the ants. When collecting videos, I would first let an ant walk into the data collection area and then start recording. Once the ant walked under the camera enough, I would stop recording and have the ant walk to the separate living chamber. I would then repeat this process for each unfilmed ant. Videos were named sequentially as “ant_#. avi” so that I could keep track of which ant was in each video. Methodology: System Pipeline Once videos of the ants were collected, I used YOLO V8 to find video frames where ants were present. I then saved a cropped image of the ant from the YOLO detection in a folder corresponding to thatant’s identity. Ant images are then put into the same convolutional neural network, known as a siamese network, that outputs a feature vector, or embedding, for each image. By finding the difference between embeddings of two images and taking the norm of that difference a distance is obtained. By comparing thisdistance to a threshold, I was able to determine if ants were the same or different.  Model Summary The model itself outputs a 128 element feature vector. To train it I used a loss function known as triplet loss. Training with triplet loss can be understood intuitively by giving the trainer 3 images at each training step, an anchor, a positive, and a negative. The anchor is an image of any ant, the positive is then a different picture of the same ant, and the negative is a picture of a different ant. During training, the model weights will be updated so that the distance between anchor and positive embeddings is smaller than the distance between anchor and negative embeddings.  Triplet Loss Function Cost Function with Triplet Loss Triplet loss makes this work because the distances between the anchor positive pair minus the anchor negative pair plus some margin must be less than zero. Because the difference between distances must be negative, the anchor negative distance must be larger than the anchor positive distance. The margin is then used to try and push the distances from the anchor to positive and negative embeddings further from each other. Because the max is taken between the difference of distances and zero, the loss will be zero when distances are separated by the defined margin. The model was trained on 18,845 images of 45 different ants. Results: To choose a threshold, I tested a range of thresholds between the average anchor-positive distance andaverage anchor-negative distance. The threshold was chosen by picking the value that achieved thehighest accuracy.  Threshold Test The model was tested on two different test sets. One contained 2,357 different images of 45 ants that the model had seen in training and the other had 3,687 images of 10 unseen ants. On the dataset of previouslyseen ants, the model achieved a true positive rate of 95. 21%, a true negative rate of 99. 6% and an accuracyof 97. 3%. On the dataset of unseen ants, the model achieved a true positive rate of 80. 67%, a true negative rate of 93. 68% and an accuracy of 86. 04%. Accuracy here is defined as the number of true positives plus the number of true negative over the total number of predictions. "

    "title": "Custom built ROV/AUV",
    "body": "2023/03/15 - ROS2, Electrical Design, Mechanical Design, Python, Mavlink Overview: View the Halo Documentation: Halo AUV is a robot I created to serve as platform for student’s in my master’s program at Northwestern Universityto use to learn about underwater robotics and expand upon. Personally, I wanted to gain experiencein underwater robotics while also building a robot from the ground up. The robot can run as a remotelyoperated vehicle (ROV) and has been integrated with ROS2 to further explore autonomous capabilities. Below is a block diagramdescribing the architecture of the robot.  Halo AUV Block Diagram On Halo itself, the Pixhawk handles low level control and sends the commands to move the motors. It relays depth information from a barometer and heading information from its internal sensors to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi sends these sensor measurements alongside the camera stream via Ethernet to a laptop. The measurements and camera stream are then sent to either QGroundControl (ROV mode) or to ROS2 nodesthat publish the images to a ROS topic and perform different control functions. In ROV mode, control inputcomes from a PlayStation controller manned by a human. When high level control commands are received, they aresent back to the Raspberry Pi over the Ethernet tether and eventually to the Pixhawk to move the robot. Mechanical Design: The key aspects of the mechanical design are that it is easy to manufacture, highly adjustable, and has the abilityto easily add on new payloads/sensors. The design is also centered around the BlueRobotics 3” and 4” watertightenclosures.  View the Mechanical Design: Halo AUV The frame itself is constructed of two parallel laser-cut pieces of acrylic that are mounted to the water tight enclosure and reinforced with multiple standoffs. Once the top and bottom frames are cut, the only tools needed to assemble the frame are common hex keys. The assembly process takes about 10 minutes. The vehicle also consists of six slotted mounts along the bottom of the frame for adding and moving weights. These are used to adjust the vehicle’s overall weight and to align the it center of buoyancy with its center of gravity. This ensures that the vehicle is neutrally bouyant and level in the water. The current design allows for weights to be added and shifted sothat adjustments can be made quickly. This is especially useful for adding new payloads to the vehicleas they will change the weight and buoyancy balance of the robot. Additionally, floats may be addedto increase the buoyancy.   Weight Sliders, Corner Weights, and Buoyancy Floats Additionally, payloads and sensors can also be easily added to Halo. There are many mounting holes liningall sides of the frame and going down the center. The weight mounts are a good example of how new payloadsmay be added. Electrical Design: The following image displays Halo’s electrical layout. Everything is powered from a 14. 8 V 9000 mAhLiPo battery. The motors receive 14. 8 V power through motor controllers that receive commands from the Pixhawk. All other components are powered off of the output of a 5 V step down converter. Communication is established from thetopside computer to the robot via Cat5e cable. The camera and Pixhawk connect to the Raspberry Pi via USB. The depth sensorcommunicates with the Pixhawk through I2C. Motor positions for the thrusters and camera gimbal are communicated through PWMfrom the Pixhawk to the respective motors.  Wiring Diagram Software: The onboard Raspberry Pi interfaces with the Pixhawk using the Ardusub companion software. The Pixhawk is also running the Ardusub firmware. The robot can be used as an ROV by downloading the QGroundControl (QGC) software. When using the robot as an ROV, a user simply has to plug the robot’s tether into their laptop and run QGC. This software allows someone to control the robot with a standard video game controller while getting depth information, heading information, and a first person view from onboard the robot.  QGroundControl View in ROV Mode Halo is also integrated with ROS2 through two nodes that handle control of the robot and publishing the stream from the robot’scamera to a ROS topic. The control node initializes contact with the robot via Mavlink to send commands and receive sensor data. When the node first starts, it reads in the robot’s current heading and depth to hold the AUV at those values. There are then two servicesto move the robot’s heading and depth either to an absolute value or by a relative amount. The controllers for heading and depth wereimplemented using PI control. Similarly, there is a controller to move the robot forward, however, there is no internal sensor to measureits forward displacement. This controller could be implemented using an external measurement like an AprilTag. The camera node reads in the camera stream from the robot via UDP. It then converts it to a gstream video feed to an OpenCV stream and then aROS2 sensor_msgs image message. This is then published to a ROS topic to be used by other nodes.  View it on Github: "

    "body": "2022/12/11 - C, Mechatronics, Embedded Systems, I2C Overview: As part of Northwestern’s microprocessor design course, my group and I created an Electromyography(EMG) controlled robotic manipulator. This allows a user to connect an EMG sensor to their arm toopen and close a robotic gripper by simply opening and closing their hand. We also combined project with another group in the class who were controlling a 2 DOF robotic arm’s motion based off of IMU data. By combining these projects, we were able to create a system that would move a robot arm and control the gripper based off of the user’s motion. EMG Gripper: This project was developed around the Microbit V2. Code is typically written to the Microbit in Python,however, we were writing directly to the Microbit’s microcontroller (nRF52833) in C. The end-effectoritself is a mechanical gripper that opens and closes based off of the position of a connected servo. We controlled this servo with a PCA9685 servo driver over I2C. Additionally, we used two sensorsin this project: an EMG sensor and a force sensitive resistor (FSR). The EMG sensor measures electrical signals in muscles that are generated from movement. This is attached to the users arm with electrodesand used to detect if the hand is closed or not. The FSR measures the amount offorce that is applied to it. This is placed on the inside of the gripper and used to detect if the gripper is actively gripping something. The basic operation of this system is that the output of the two sensors are constantly being readby the Microbit. If the EMG sensor gives a high signal, then the user is trying to grasp. When thisis detected, PWM signals are sent to the servo driver over I2C in a loop, closing the gripper incrementallywith each iteration. When an item is grasped, a forced is applied to the FSR, producing a high signal that is used to break the grasping loop and hold the gripper at a constant position. Once, the user releases their grasp, the gripper will then start to incrementally open, unlessinterrupted by another grasp command.  View EMG Gripper Github: EMG Gripper + IMU Arm: When the EMG gripper is combined with the IMU controlled arm, the resulting system allows a user tomanipulate the robot to perform various actions just by moving their own arm and hand.

    "body": "2022/12/09 - Computer Vision, OpenCV, ROS2, Python, Motion Planning, Moveit, Intel Realsense, Emika Franka Robot Arm Overview: The purpose of this project was to create hot chocolate using the Franka Emika 7 DOF robot arm. To perceive its environment, the system utilizes an Intel D435i camera AprilTags. Upon initial setup, a calibration process must be completed. After this, the process consisted of using AprilTags to locate a scoop of cocoa, a mug, a spoon, and a kettle relative to the robot. Next, using our custom MoveIt API for Python, movebot, the robot is able to perform path planning between all of these objects. It turns on the kettle, dumps the cocoa powder into the mug, pours the hot water over the power, and stirs the mixture it with the spoon.  View BotChocolate Github: Moveit API: Because the ROS2 MoveIt package does not have a Python API yet, creating one was the first step. By looking into the MoveIt ROS2 actions and services, we were able to create an API that takes either Cartesian coordinates of the Franka end-efffector or joint-state positions of each joint and createsa path to the specified position. It also allows for the choice of moving in a Cartesian path. Vision: The vision system is comprised of two major parts: calibration and component location. AprilTags areused to detect where each of the hot chocolate making components are. The AprilTags are located usingthe apriltag_ros package. There is one tag fixed to a kettle and one tag fixed to a jig that has slots for a mug, cocoa scooper,and a spoon. Once these tags are found in the camera frame, there are two transformation trees describing where all the hot chocolate components are relative to the camera and where each link ofthe Franka robot arm is relative to the robot’s base. However, we need to connect these trees to get the location of each component relative to the robot’s base. This is where the calibration is used. An AprilTag must be placed in the robot’s gripper, aligned with the gripper’scoordinate frame and in view of the camera to calibrate. We then wrote a program that finds the location of the tagand relates it to the position of the base, connecting the robot frame to the camera frame. We thensave this transformation to a . yaml file to be used later on when running the main hot chocolatemaking sequence. After obtaining the transformation from the camera to the robot, the robot can now use the locationsof the two AprilTags to locate and manipulate the hot chocolate components as necessary. Motion Planning: Once the locations of all the components are known, it’s time to make hot chocolate. Cartesian pathsare used to move the robot in straight lines and rotational path planning is used for achieving motionslike tilting to grab the scoop and dumping the cocoa. Both Cartesian and rotational motion are used to achieve pouring. To make a cup of hot chocolate, the robot first turns on the kettle to heat the water, grab the cocoa scoop, pours it in a mug, pours the hot water over the powder, and stirs. We also used serval intermediate waypoints to help avoid reaching the joint limits of the robot. The Team:  Shantao Cao Allan Garcia-Casal Nicholas Marks James Oubre David Dorf "

Using the transformation matrices between these frames, I am able to detect impact if any of the smaller box’s vertices intersect the larger box’s walls. Each vertex is checked against each wall for every time step of the simulation. If an impact is detected, the dynamic equations are updated andthe simulation continues.  View it on Github: "

First, I created a functionto generate trajectories from the robot’s starting position to all the different waypoints to complete the task. The homogeneous transformation matrices between waypoints are used to create a screw or Cartesian trajectories between points. These trajectories are then stored in a matrix representing the desired movement of the robot’s chassis and end effector. Next, I implemented a PID feedbackcontroller based off of the robot’s current position and odometry to ensure that the robot can selfcorrect if error is introduced. Lastly, the actual positions of the robot are stored in a CSV fileand used to simulate the robot in Coppeliasim. Results: The simulation completed the task in three different scenarios: with poor PID gains, tunedPID gains, and a different start and end configuration for the cube.  Overall, each simulation is able to reduce to zero error before the robot gets the the cube’s standoff position.  View it on Github: "

To detect the pen, I converted the RGB image from the Realsense to an HSV image and used the HSV valuesto find all purple pixels. Next, I created a binary map where the detected pixels were shown as white and all other pixels black. Using this and OpenCv’s contour detection I found the pixel locationof the centroid of pen. This allowed me to find the location of the pen relative to the camera using the aligned depth image generated from the Realsense. I then convert the pen position from the camera’sframe to the robot’s frame and control the robot to move to the pen and grasp it.  View it on Github: "

    "body": "2022/05/22 - Computer Vision, OpenCV, UR5 Robot Arm, Manufacturing, Research, Intel Realsense Overview: While getting my bachelor’s degree at Louisiana State University I worked as an undergraduate researcherin the Innovation in Control and Robotics Engineering Lab (iCORE Lab). My main area of research wascomputer vision for robotic systems. Specifically, as part of an NSF funded research project, Icreated a computer vision system to detect surface defects in fiber glass for autonomous sanding. Once, the locations of the defects were found, two types of path planning were used to create a sandingpath. The path waypoints were then relayed to a UR5e 6 DOF robot arm with a sander attachment to sand the defected areas.  System Pipeline System Components Read the paper: Vision: Using traditional computer vision techniques like canny edge detection, morphological closing, contour detection, and binary mapping I was able to detect and isolate defects present on the surfaceof a fiber glass panel.  Computer Vision Pipeline First, an Intel D435i camera captures the RGB and depth images of the fiber glass sample. A canny edge detector is applied to the RGB image to separate the inherit pattern visible underneath the surface of the fiber glass from the defects present on the surface. After this step, the surface defects become easily visible. To create a general region of the defective area, I use morphologicalclosing to merge nearby edges and fill openings within a certain area to create a blob like structurewhere defects reside. Next I use contour detection to get the pixel locations of everything withinthe defective regions. Path Planning: Once the locations of the defects are known, a path must be created so the robot can sand over allof the defective areas. Two different types of path planning were implemented. Multi-goal path planningwas needed to make sure the robot goes to each of the separate defective regions and coverage pathplanning was used to ensure the robot sanded all of the defects within a given region. For multi-goal path planning, a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented to create a path that went to each region based off of the location of the regions centroid. Next, a grid-based sweeping algorithm is used to create a path that covers the entire area. Finally, the two plans are combinedand the robot’s sander is pressed against the piece for the coverage paths to ensure sanding and it is offset from the piece during multi-goal movements so that smooth sections are not sanded erroneously.   Example of Finalized Path in 2D and 3D Results: The system successfully detected the defected areas and we quantified the results by having a personmanually label defects in one of the fiber glass image samples and compared that to what the systemdetected. Fifteen fiber glass panels were used and the calculated average sensitivity obtained was 66. 24%, the average specificity was 78. 20%, and the resulting accuracy was 81. 02%. Furthermore, using a profilometer, I measured the surface roughness of certain defected areas before and after sanding and found that the average roughness at these areas was about half as rough after performingautonomous sanding.

Using three ultrasonic distance sensors offset at different heights, the system can detect three different heights of cups corresponding to a wine glass, pint glass, and a cocktail glass. I implemented logicon an Arduino to decide what kind of glass is present based off the sensor outputs. Once the type ofcup is known, the Arduino turns on pumps connected to the corresponding cocktail ingredients. Originally,the system was supposed to dispense wine for the wine glass, beer for the pint, and a mixed drink forthe cocktail glass. However, beer did not dispense properly from the pump and it mostly dispensedfoam so I changed it to dispense a different mixed drink. I also did not actually have any wine when making the video so I used water. The logic used is shown in the pipeline below.  System Pipeline Electrical Design: The electrical design is shown in the image below. The system is powered from a wall outlet to a 12V power supply. A 7 V voltage regulator is used to power the Arduino and the 12 volts powers a relay module which, in turn, powers the pumps. To actually dispense the liquid, the Arduino sends a high signal to the corresponding pin on the relay module to close the relay and turn on the pump.  Electrical Schematic "

    "body": "2021/05/23 - Circuit Design, Power Systems, PCB Design, Digital Logic, Mechanical Design, Manufacturng Overview: For my senior capstone project, I was a part of a group that converted an internal combustion FSAEracecar to be fully electric. The electrical side of the project consisted of creating a custom highvoltage battery pack (accumulator) with a battery management system to power the vehicle’s motor. There was also a low voltage subsystem composed of a device to check for braking and accelerating faults, a circuitto cut off high voltage power in dangerous scenarios, and 12 V bus for miscellaneous electronics. Furthermore,because we were converting an existing internal combustion vehicle, certain mechanical alterationswere made. Personally, I was responsible for the low voltage subsystem and acted as team treasurer. Low Voltage Electrical: The low voltage system is broken up into three main parts: the acceleration and brake fault detection device, the safety shutdown circuit, and the 12 V bus. The purpose of this subsystem is to handle all auxiliary functions of the vehicle. Basically any function of the car outside of the high voltage power train is a part of the low voltage system. Below is the circuit diagram for the vehicles auxiliary systems.  Low Voltage Auxillory System Circuit Diagram  Auxillory System PCBs Acceleration and Brake Fault Detection Device: One key feature of this project is the acceleration and brake fault detection device. This device detects the following accelerating and braking conditions that could cause harm to the driver:  Simultaneous pressing of accelerator and brake pedals Significant current delivered to motor while driver is hard braking Short or open circuits in the accelerator and break pedal sensorsIf any of these faults were detected, a trigger signal is sent to a 500 ms timer which would then actuate a relay to open the safety shutdown circuit and cut off high voltage power. The logic is described in the diagram below.  Accelerator and Brake Pedal Fault Detection Logic Per FSAE rules, the device had to be compeltely analog. Because of this, I chose to detect faults using op-amp comparators and logic gates. If the input signal from the sensor went above a certain value or outside a specified range, the comparator would send a high signal to 500 ms timer. Below isthe circuit diagram for the device.  Accelerator and Brake Pedal Fault Detection Circuit Diagram Using EaglePCB, I created the manufacturing drawings for the board’s PCB. I then ordered the board and soldered the components on myself.  Accelerator and Brake Pedal Fault Detection PCB Safety Shutdown Circuit: A safety shutdown circuit was created to cut off high powered electricity in unsafe conditions. Thiscircuit connects the 12 V battery to the coils of the two high power relays that are connected to the vehicle’s high power battery or accumulator. The rest of the circuit is a number of switches andrelays in series such that if any are disconnected, the circuit is open and no voltage is applied to the accumulator relay coils. When there is no voltage at these coils, they are open and the accumulatoris disconnected. The circuit has 3 emergency stop buttons, 2 master switches, a brake over travel switch, and 2 low voltage relays. The brake over travel switch is a toggle switch located behind the break pedal such that if the brakes are pressed extremely hard, the flip is switched and the circuit is opened. The 2 low voltage relays are connected to the acceleration and brake fault detection device (shown as APPS/BSPD) and the insulation monitoring device (IMD). The IMD measures the insulation between the high voltage bus and the chassis ground. If a short between the two is detected, the device outputs a high signal to open the relay in the shutdown circuit.  Safety Shutdown Circuit Low Voltage Power: Part of this project was ensuring it could withstand the FSAE endurance event which we calculated wouldtake about 30 minutes. To spec out the battery for this, I found the max current draw of each componenton the 12 V bus to be 34. 6 A. To complete the endurance event the vehicle required a battery with acapacity of 17. 3 Ah.  12 V Bus High Voltage Electrical: The high voltage powertrain shown below consists of the high voltage battery pack (accumulator), accumulator isolation relays, high voltage disconnects, motor controller, and the motor. The accumulatorisolation relays and high voltage disconnects are used to isolate the accumulator when not driving. The high voltage lines are then fed into the motor controller which operates the motor based on theinput from the accelerator pedal position sensors.  High Voltage Bus The accumulator itself was made of 756 18650 Li-ion rechargeable cells broken up into 9 parallel connections of 84 series connections. Because the motor we selected was a 300 V motor, we required a300 V battery pack. After performing a simulation of the endurance event it was determined that a battery required at least a 6. 3 kWh capacity at this voltage to finish. Because 18650 cells have a nominal voltage of 3. 6 V, we concluded that 84 cells in series were necessary. Furthermore, to reach the current requirement (21 Ah), we calculated that 9 cells in parallel were needed since the cell’s nominal capacity is 2. 5 Ah. We also used an off-the-shelf battery management system to ensure propercell balancing and charging.  Battery Model Manufacturing: To assemble the battery pack, series connections were made by spot welding positive and negativeterminals together with nickel strips. Parallel connections were made by screwing thicker nickelstrips into a copper bus bar.   Battery Segment Manufacturing Mechanical: The mechanical systems of the vehicle are shown below. Changes to the drivetrain and cooling system were necessary when changing from internal combustion to electric and a battery housing was neededto protect and insulate the battery segments.

Two of the courses that I found particularly useful were Intro to Robotics Engineering and Autonomous Robotic Vehicles In Intro to Robotics Engineering we learned about a broad array of topics from mechanical design to software. We learned about robotic actuators and mobility mechanisms, robot motion control, navigation and mapping, and human-robot interaction. Particularly, we had many interesting projects involving the Parallax Activitybots, hexapods, and Turtlebots. Furthermore, the class focused heavily on learningROS and had many labs, classes, and assignments dedicated to learning it. Autonomous Robotic Vehicles covered topics like vehicle kinematics, motion control, perception, localization, path planning, and navigation. In the class we learned about and implemented different probabilistic methods like Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for navigation.

Theprogram was written using Python and OpenCV and the algorithm pipeline is shown below. System Pipeline First, the user takes an image of the flag and draws a rectangle around the flag. This region is cropped out and the color of the flag is then detected. After the color of the flag is found, the flag is cropped out using contour detection and the pixel length of the side of the flag is measured. Using this pixel length, the distance to the flag could be calculated using triangle similarity anddisplayed on the user’s screen. Results: Overall, the range finder worked well. It was very precise and accurate for smaller distances. However, as the distances began to increase, the program was less successful. Test results can be seen below. One reason this could be happening is that the farther away the flag is, the smaller it is on the picture. This makes it much more difficult get an accurate pixel count to calculate the distance to the flag. Using a higher resolution image could help mitigate this problem.
