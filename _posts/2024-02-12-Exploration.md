Programmed a Unitree Go1 robot to autonomously explore an unknown environment while searching for human beings in C++, Python and Ros 2 using 3D SLAM and Computer Vison.

## Overview
The main aim of this project is to enable any robot to autonomously explore and detect humans in an unknown environment. It also has a facial recognition ability. The project is divided into several sections:
1. **Autonomous Exploration and Mapping**:
2. **Human Detection**:
3. **Facial Recognition**:
4. **Integration with any Robot**:
