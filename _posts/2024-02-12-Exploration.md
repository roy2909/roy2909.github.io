Developing an autonomous exploration and detection system using RTAB-Map with a Quadruped (Unitree Go1) Robot and a UGV (Clearpath Jackal) Robot. The system will be able to detect humans and objects in an unknown environment and also have the ability to find a person on showing it a picture.

## Overview
### This post is a work in progess. The final post will be available by March 16, 2024.
The main aim of this project is to enable any robot to autonomously explore and detect humans in an unknown environment. It was also have the ability to find a person on showing it a picture. The project is divided into several sections:
1. **Frontier Exploration**:
2. **Human Detection**:
3. **Facial Recognition**:
4. **Integration with any Robot**:
