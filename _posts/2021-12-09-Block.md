Mobile Manipulation / CoppeliaSim / PI Control

![Block Pick and Place](https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/449Final.gif)

As the capstone for the Robotic Manipulation course, I created a software package to direct a Kuka YouBot to pick up and move a block in CoppeliaSim. This required first generating a trajectory for the end effector to reach the initial and final block locations, with intermediate stand-off and gripping poses, and then using inverse kinematics to determine the arm and chassis configurations. Additionally, I implemented a proportional integral controller to help correct for deviation from the planned trajectory. 

#### Controller Tuning

##### Best performance: Kp = 3, Ki = 0

For the best preformance, I chose a proportioal gain of 3 and an integral gain of 0.

##### Initial Overshoot: Kp = 3, Ki = 4

To simulate an initial overshoot, I chose a proportioal gain of 3 and an integral gain of 4.
